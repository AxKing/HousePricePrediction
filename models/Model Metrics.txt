The final model is a linear regression model. I used RMSE to pick the best model from the 4 I created. From using the GridSearch method to optimize the model, the final model will fit the intercept and has an RMSE:  70056.18127996859.
To use the model you’ll need to input an array of values. The array will have the following:
[housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income, median_house_value.median,1,0,0,0]
The last 4 values are to indicate the ocean proximity.
Inland 1,0,0,0
Island 0,1,0,0
Near_Bay 0,0,1,0
Near_Ocean 0,0,0,1
Ocean_Front 0,0,0,0
All except the last 4 values will need to be normalized like the example in the Model folder.
